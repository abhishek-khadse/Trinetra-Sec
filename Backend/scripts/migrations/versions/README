This directory contains the migration scripts for the database schema.

Each migration script is automatically generated and should not be manually edited.

## Creating a new migration

1. Make changes to your SQLAlchemy models
2. Run: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description of changes"`
3. Review the generated migration script
4. Run: `alembic upgrade head` to apply the migration

## Reverting a migration

To revert to a previous version:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1  # Revert one migration
alembic downgrade <revision_id>  # Revert to a specific revision
```

## Viewing migration history

```bash
alembic history  # Show migration history
alembic current  # Show current database revision
```
